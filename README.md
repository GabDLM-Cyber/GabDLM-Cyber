## Hi there 👋

I'm **Gabriel**, a cybersecurity engineering student based in France.

I break things to learn how to fix them.

While I regularly practice offensive security on **TryHackMe**, my endgame is **Blue Team** operations. I believe you can't effectively defend a fortress if you don't know how the invaders think.

My time with the **SNCF security team** gave me a glimpse into real-world defense at scale. It taught me that security isn't just about tools, but about processes, reactivity, and protecting critical data.

My main focus right now is building custom **Home Labs**. Instead of just consuming content, I design my own vulnerable networks to test detection rules and incident response workflows.

**My Toolbox:**
My stack relies heavily on open-source solutions. I deploy **Wazuh** as my SIEM and **pfSense** for firewalling, combined with **Wireshark** for deep analysis. I am perfectly comfortable navigating between **Kali** and **Ubuntu** environments.

**Fun Facts:**
* 🧠 I spend more time reading logs than social media.
* 🏗️ Big fan of "Security by Design".
* 🎯 Working towards a specialized role in SOC Operations or GRC Consulting.
